# LSTM Word Predictor

The LSTM Word Predictor is a deep learning model designed to predict the next word in a sequence of text. Built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in handling sequential data. The model can be trained on any text corpus and used to generate coherent text or assist in text completion tasks.

## Features

- Utilizes LSTM architecture for sequential data processing
- Trained on a custom text corpus for specific applications
- Capable of generating text and predicting the next word in a sequence
- Easy to customize and extend with different datasets

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

## Working

In text generation, our goal is to predict the next character or word in a sequence. Typically, the text data comprises a series of characters, where each character serves as input. . Given that text generation often requires the retention of significant amounts of preceding data, LSTMâ€™s capability to retain long-term dependencies makes it the preferred choice.

The neural network receives a sequence of words as input, and its output consists of a matrix of probabilities for each word in the dictionary to follow the given sequence. Additionally, the model learns the semantic similarity between each word or character and computes the probability accordingly. Leveraging this information, we can predict or generate the subsequent word or character in the sequence.
